Properties and Constructor:

Properties are declared within the class. They can have access modifiers like public, private, or protected.
The constructor initializes an object of the class.
Access Modifiers:

public: Accessible anywhere (default if no modifier is provided).
private: Accessible only within the class.
protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
Methods:

Define behavior or actions for objects of the class.
Can also have access modifiers to control visibility.


abstract classes:
Abstract Methods: These are methods without a body. They must be implemented in the derived class.
Non-abstract Methods: Abstract classes can also have methods with complete functionality, which can be used by derived classes.
Cannot be Instantiated: You cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
Can Contain Properties: Abstract classes can define properties that child classes inherit.
